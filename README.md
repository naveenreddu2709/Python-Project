I made this project in my second semester so if you face any issues please let me know.

Plan:

1. First,      Built a Home Page using Tkinter 
2. Second,     Make designs for Background using ppt and other tools or images 
3. Third,      Create a Simple Clock on Home Page
4. Fourth,     Built the applications Buttons
5. Fifth,      Link these button with python file (when clicked run that file)
6. Sixth,      Make a Snake Game using Pygame and ensure background music with high Score save and update.
7. Seventh,    Make a Temp File clear Program that automatically delete all files (if Possible) that present in "temp" Folder.      Press win key - Enter: %temp% - Press Enter to open temp folder
8. 8th,        Write a Quiz Program using 30 Question and show Random 10 To user.
9. 9th,        For not having any problem Place all files in same directory.
10.       Finally it got Completed

Some things may not be good, but at that time I was doing it all alone. 
I hope I will do better in the future.
